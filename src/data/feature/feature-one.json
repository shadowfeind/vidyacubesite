But our MIS is totally applicable for university level education institution system based on semester or trimester. The appearance of your student records says a lot about the quality of your institution. . Other educators and registrars make judgments based on student records that can permanently affect a student's life. MIS capabilities include the basics such as transcripts, report cards, attendance, and discipline as well as many other specialized capabilities, including parental access to real time student grades on the Internet.",
    "paragraph2": "This means that not only administrators but also parents, teachers, and students have access to real-time data. With traditional reporting methods parents may not find out how their student is performing in school until the end of the quarter or semester, usually too late to correct a problem situation. MIS allows parents to know how their student is doing on a continual basis by using the internet."
